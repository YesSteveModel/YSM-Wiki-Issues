## How to Install the Mod

The latest release version of the mod is: `2.4.0`

The mod works on:

<Card title="Version 2.4.0" icon="icon-park-outline:tag">

- Forge: `1.20.1`, `1.19.2`, `1.18.2`, `1.16.5`
- Fabric: `1.21.1`, `1.21`, `1.20.1`, `1.19.2`, `1.18.2`, `1.16.5`
- NeoForge: `1.21.1`, `1.21`

</Card>

Due to review issues on CurseForge, the YSM mod has been removed from it. Please download the latest version on Modrinth:

- Modrinth: <https://modrinth.com/mod/yes-steve-model/versions>

A major reconstruction was made in version `1.2.0`. Most new models cannot be loaded in version `1.1.5` and below.

We always expect that you can use the latest version. You can check the version by looking at the texts on the lower left corner in the Select Model menu:

::: warning

- Please distinguish the difference between `Forge` and `Fabric` when downloading!

Watch some walkthrough videos in case you really don't know how to install the mod.

## How to Get Models

Most Chinese creators post model demonstration videos on Bilibili. You can search related keywords on Bilibili to find the model you want.
Also, some creators post models (either free or paid) on AFDIAN. There is a free model collection maintained by enthusiasts in the YSM community as well.
Some creators post models on Planet Minecraft.

## I Can't Find My Model

If you have installed your model following the instructions above, but still cannot find it, please check the following:

- Did you actually have the mod installed?
- Did you have the latest version (2.4.0) of the mod installed? Most new models requires mod version 2.2.2 or above. Version 1.1.5 is no longer supported!
- Were you in multiplayer? Only the OP can install models on a server.
- Have you executed the command `/ysm model reload` to reload the models?
- If you were playing for the first time, and have quite a lot of models installed, you could be in a situation where only the default model is available after reloading. Please wait for a while as the mod is building cache for your models, after which the models should show up. (Same for multiplayer)
