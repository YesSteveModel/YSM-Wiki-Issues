The Yes Steve Model mod uses `geckolib` as its core, therefore it supports model files of `Bedrock Edition 1.12.0 and above` and animation files of `Bedrock Edition 1.8.0` that are compatible with `geckolib`.

Since version 2.3.0, we have also added support for Bedrock Edition animation controllers and animation audio.

## Model Format

There are three formats for model files. All of them can be recognized and loaded by the game when placed in the specified directory:

- Folder format: The most recommended format for model designers. It enables easy modification of model contents and quick reloading for testing in the game.
- Compressed package format: A direct packaging of the folder format, which is convenient for sharing with others.
- ysm format: An encrypted packaging of the folder format. It is convenient for sharing with others while preventing the model files from being modified or misused.

## Where to Place Model Files

All custom model files are placed in the `config/yes_steve_model` folder under the main game directory. Four folders will be automatically generated under `yes_steve_model`:

- `auth` folder: Used to place custom models. The custom models in this folder **must be authorized** before they can be used.
- `cache` folder: A cache folder for encrypted model files automatically obtained from the server by the system.
- `custom` folder: Used to place custom models. The custom models in this location can be used **without authorization**.
- `export` folder: When the `/ysm export` command is used in the game, the models in the exclusive ysm format generated will be here.

You can choose to place custom model files directly either in the `auth` or the `custom` folder.

::: warning
Some models are set to be forced free. They can always be used without authorization even if put under the `auth` folder.
:::

::: tip
Starting from version 2.2.1, in order to address the practice of many players who like to modify file names or create multiple layers of folders in the directory, we have modified the file reading logic.

Now, as long as it is in the `custom` or `auth` directory, regardless of how many layers of subfolders are nested (up to 16 layers), whether it is a folder, a compressed package, or in the ysm format, it can be correctly recognized. At the same time, file names support any characters (including Chinese).

## Encryption Format Description

- Encrypted model files in the ysm format cannot be converted back to ordinary model files, and ==they cannot be modified a second time!==
- The ysm format is backward-compatible, which means that if a ysm format file is exported using a higher version of the mod, it cannot be loaded in a lower version!
- Enter the command `/ysm export <model_id>` in the game to export a model in the folder format as the exclusive ysm model format.
- Starting from version 2.2.2, this command also supports the syntax `/ysm export <model_id> [extra_info]`. You can add custom text information with `extra_info`. It will be attached to the exported ysm file.
