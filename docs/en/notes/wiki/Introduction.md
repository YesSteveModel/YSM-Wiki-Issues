## Basic Introduction

The Yes Steve Model mod takes into account the mod requirements of the server community and adopts many designs suitable for the server environment, including but not limited to:

- Automatic synchronization of client models: When ordinary players enter the server, the server will ==automatically== synchronize the models to the players' computers.
- Encrypted model files: All the models sent to the player clients are ==encrypted binary files==, effectively avoiding model theft!
- Model permission function: Models can be individually authorized. Only after the OP enters the command to authorize, specific models can be used.
- Modification of the original player model: The default Steve and Alex models are added, and both models can automatically use the player's skin as their textures.
- Animation roulette function: When the `Z` key is pressed, an animation roulette is opened, where you can conveniently play various interesting animations (such as motions, expressions, etc.)
- Maid model rendering support: Installing Touhou Little Maid mod version 1.2.0+ with Yes Steve Model mod version 2.4.0+ allows you to use YSM models and animations on maids.

## Platform Support

Versions 1.1.5 and earlier were written in pure Java and support the three major mainstream platforms and mobile platforms.

Since the encryption algorithm of the old versions written in Java was quickly cracked, starting from version 1.2.0, the core encryption and rendering parts are all written in C++. This greatly improves the rendering performance and security, but the multi-platform support is poor.

Currently, the client side only supports Windows x64 systems, while the server side supports Windows and Linux x64 systems. Support for other platforms and architectures is also in progress. Updates will be announced if there are any progresses.
