- Fix the problem that the free field of the independent manifest file is not processed

- Add `ysm.bone_pivot_abs` to get the coordinates of the specified bone pivot point in the model space in the previous frame.

  > Note that if the parent bone is hidden or scaled by 0, the value will not be updated. Example: `ysm.bone_pivot_abs('LeftHand').x`;

- Add ysm.bone\_[rot/scale/pos] to get the bone parameters of the previous frame.

  > Example: `ysm.bone_rot("LeftLeg').x`;

- Improved the rendering of semi-transparent models;

- Added `properties.render_layers_first field` (default false) to the manifest file to specify whether the vanilla model layer is rendered before the ysm model. The specific details will be introduced in the document later;

# Known issues:
- The semi-transparent part of the model may block other entities, which can be solved by installing the oculus/iris module;
- The semi-transparent part of the model in the inventory will block buttons added by other modules.
- The animation will only play once when TACZ fires continuously
