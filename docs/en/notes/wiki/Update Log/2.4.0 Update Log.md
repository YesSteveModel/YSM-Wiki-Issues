## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where clients without YSM installed could not enter the server.
- Fixed an issue with unplayed animation sound effects in multiple animation states.
- Corrected a problem where buttons were not recognizing boolean values in the custom configuration for the roulette animation.
- In animation control, scaling animation blending is now multiplicative instead of additive (aligning with Bedrock Edition mechanics).
- Modified the second-order animation calculation mechanism, allowing second-order animations to play correctly at very low frame rates.
- Audio is now forced to play in mono (only supports Forge 1.21/1.20/1.19/1.18).
- Fixed a bug where audio would not stop in certain situations.
- Attempted to fix a bug where the first frame would be blank when using or swinging animations.
