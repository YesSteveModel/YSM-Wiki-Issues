  - Changed Fox Spirit flight animation to helicopter style (Thanks to @Xiaomomo)
  - Added Large Fox Spirit model (Thanks to @Can't Stand Teacher)
  - Optimized and updated Magic Fox Spirit animation (Thanks to @Starry Sea)

- New Molang variables:
  - Attack swing related Molang:
    - `ysm.swinging`: Boolean, returns true when the player is swinging
    - `ysm.swing_time`: Integer, returns the swing count when the player is swinging, usually within 10
    - `ysm.swinging_arm`: The swinging arm, main hand is 0, off hand is 1
    - `ysm.attack_time`: Float, attack windup counter; between 0-1, attack triggers when it reaches 1
  - `query.rotation_to_camera`: Consistent with Bedrock Edition usage, returns `yaw` and `pitch` of the player camera view
  - `ctrl.tac_fire_mode`: Returns the tacz fire mode string
  - `ysm.hit_target_id`: Returns the block or entity ID pointed at by the mouse cursor
  - `ysm.hit_target_type`: Returns the target type pointed at by the mouse cursor, returns `block` for blocks, `entity` for entities
  - `ctrl.bcombat_attack_animation`: Returns Better Combat attack animation, note that this animation does not distinguish between main/off hand, additional conditions are needed
  - Immersive Music mod related:
    - `ctrl.im_pitch`: Pitch, usually between 0-2
    - `ctrl.im_volume`: Volume, usually between 0-2
    - `ctrl.im_current`: Level intensity, range 0-1
    - `ctrl.im_delta`: Time elapsed since last note output (in milliseconds)
    - `ctrl.im_time`: Time elapsed since playback started (in milliseconds)
  - `ctrl.iss_animation`: Iron's Spells casting animation

## Mod Compatibility

### 1. Better Combat Mod

Better Combat can currently be implemented through the default swing animation, with no additional dedicated animations for now.

More refined Better Combat animations can be achieved by using `ctrl.bcombat_attack_animation` Molang with animation controllers.

Fixed several Better Combat compatibility issues:

- Fixed the issue of weapon swinging not triggering animations
- Fixed rendering issues in first-person view when shaders are enabled
- Fixed the issue of swing animation not synchronizing in multiplayer games

### 2. Immersive Melodies Mod

Added dedicated `im.animation.json` animation file, containing default animations for 11 instruments.

Added 5 Molang variables related to current music playback for creating dynamic animations.

Thanks to @lucia2048 for creating the music animations.

### 3. Iron's Spells 'n Spellbooks

Added dedicated `iss.animation.json` animation file for Iron's Spells casting animations (extensible for compatibility with other addon mods).

Added 1 Molang variable related to current casting animation.

Thanks to @Acreia and @lucia2048 Sea for creating the casting animations.
