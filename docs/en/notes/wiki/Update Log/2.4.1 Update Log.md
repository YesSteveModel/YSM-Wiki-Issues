- Fixed the bug that Forge 1.18.2 could not open the maid skin interface

- Added function to switch the rendering of the sophisticated backpack
- Added molang for the sophisticated backpack: `ctrl.has_sophisticated_backpack`, when the sophisticated backpack is displayed, this variable returns true
- Forge 1.18.2-1.20.1 restores the old ogg file
