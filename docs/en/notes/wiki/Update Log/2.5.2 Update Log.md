## Bug Fixes

- Fixed hand animation issues caused by old YSM encryption format
- Fixed potential disconnection issues during cross-server teleportation when running client-only
- Fixed abnormal head hiding functionality when compatible with Better Combat mod
- Corrected model background and foreground image size limits, now supporting maximum 260×450 pixels
- Fixed startup failures on some servers (especially Linux servers) due to irregular configuration directory path formats
  - Server now displays accurate error messages when failing to read default models
- Fixed abnormal outline rendering when players are in both glowing and invisible states simultaneously
- Fixed abnormal GUI animation playback under specific conditions
- Fixed incorrect animation display when picking up maids with Carry On mod
- Fixed abnormal animation states when maids switch models
- Fixed issue where some Molang variables couldn't update properly when YSM wasn't installed on the server
- Fixed parameter parsing errors when using function expressions as parameters in Molang custom function calls
- Fixed incorrect Y-coordinate component handling in Molang functions for block information retrieval
- Fixed ZIP file reading failures under specific conditions
- Fixed compatibility issues with TaCZ Tweaks mod

## Performance Optimizations

- Optimized animation update frequency for distant and invisible entities to reduce performance consumption
- Improved player attribute synchronization mechanism, effectively reducing server network bandwidth usage
- Added new server configuration option: Low Bandwidth Mode
- Automatic cleanup of invalid player roaming data on server to prevent excessive NBT data
- Added more memory safety features
- Changed client texture compression format to WebP, significantly reducing memory usage

## New Features and Content Modifications

- Added support for Linux clients (Note: Client cannot run in virtual machine environments)
- Added support for Android clients
- Enhanced compatibility support for head-worn items
- Added compatibility for Simple Hat mod
- Improved entity matching mechanism for projectile and rideable entity models:
  - Support for configuring multiple entity IDs
  - Support for using entity tags for matching
- Added support for 7z compressed format models to resolve garbled text or reading failures with ZIP format
  - Supports both model files and model packs
  - When 7z compressed packages exceed 64MB, please disable "Solid Compression" and set "Solid Data Size" to no more than 64MB, then recompress
  - Note: Larger solid data provides higher compression ratios but slower loading speeds
- Complete audio system reconstruction with the following improvements:
  - Streaming decoding technology for significantly faster model loading and reduced memory usage
  - Optimized Opus decoder for higher audio quality
  - Added animation controller sound effect support
  - Added audio loop playback functionality
  - Refined audio playback context management for precise lifecycle control
  - Maintains unchanged audio Molang function usage while significantly improving playback effects (see appendix documentation)
  - Recommended to use YSM-specific Opus transcoding tool for optimal results
- Enhanced animation debugging features:
  - Support for debugging remote players, maids, projectiles, and vehicle entities
  - Use `Alt + B` key combination to debug entities pointed by mouse
  - Added `/ysmclient debug <selector>` command for precise entity matching and debugging
  - Added `/ysmclient molang execute <exp>` command to execute Molang expressions on currently debugged entities
- New Molang variable: q.delta_time
- Optimized hardcoded controller scaling frames, disabling initial transition animations
- Added model blacklist functionality to block loading of specified default models
  - Configuration file location: `<Game Directory>/yes_steve_model/blacklist.txt` (file contains detailed instructions)
- Added scroll functionality to carousel configuration interface, supporting mouse wheel and button operations
- Added YSM rendering control functionality for individual players
  - Command format: /ysm model disable <Player ID> [true | false]
- Added wine fox models: Little Wine Fox and Momo Wine Fox
- Added multiple sleeping animation effects for wine fox models (Creator: Little Momo)

## Android Platform Compatibility and Optimization

- Support for FCL, ZL, and ZL2 launchers on Android systems
  - Displays upgrade prompts in-game when outdated launcher versions are detected
- Added multiple mobile adaptation optimizations:
  - Optimized carousel configuration interface button sizes for improved mobile device operation experience
  - Added quick access buttons in pause menu (ESC interface) for skin changing, carousel configuration, and paper doll configuration interfaces
  - Enlarged control points in paper doll configuration interface for easier scaling, positioning, and rotation adjustments
  - Added reset button and show/hide toggle options for paper doll configuration interface
- Optimized system resource usage during model loading on Android
- Improved thread scheduling algorithms for Android systems
- Fixed issue where carousel animations couldn't be interrupted properly after installing Touch Controller mod
- **Important Note**：
  - YSM and Java use independent memory pools, which may have memory competition relationship
  - Allocating excessive memory to Java may cause insufficient available memory for YSM, please configure memory allocation reasonably
